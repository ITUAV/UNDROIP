SWARMs Underwater Image Processing Toolbox (UNDROIP) 
www.swarms.eu

UNDROIP has been carried out withing the SWARMS project

UNDROIP is an open-source software that can be used to process underwater side-scan sonar images. UNDROIP provides different functionalities to sidescan sonar images, such as image normalization, sea-bottom detection or bottom first returns, landmark detection, registration, speed correction, removal of water column and bathymetric matching. UNDROIP has been developed in SWARMs project within the scope of its Work Package 4 (Environment Recognition and Sensing)


Sonar imaging is currently the exemplary choice used in underwater imaging. However, since sound signals are absorbed by water and due to sound interferene and some other related problems, underwater maps obtained from sonar images will be difficult to process. UNDROIP's objective is to share fuctions of different methods that can be used, for example, to normalize the images with regard to echo deay, speed correction, registration, landmark detection, etc. The hope is that these functions are pruned further to better performance, and additional fuctions to be added in the future by the people interested in such software.
